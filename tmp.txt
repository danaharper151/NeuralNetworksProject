Modifications have been made to this dataset: 
Preprocessing steps (normalization, resizing, and train/validation/test splitting) to the original SLICE-3D dataset for use in neural network training.
May have undergone standard preprocessing or augmentation steps (e.g., resizing, normalization, data augmentation) during model training.
